2. Extract to `C:\platform-tools\`
3. Open Command Prompt and navigate to the directory



#### 🍎 Mac



**Option A: Homebrew** (recommended)

### 📱 Step 2: Prepare Tablet

#### 🔐 1. Remove All Accounts

Device Owner requires that **no user accounts** are active on the device. A factory reset is **not** required.



| 📋 Action | 🎯 Purpose |

| **✅ Verify** | Settings → Accounts should show "No accounts" |



> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can sign back into all your accounts **after** Device Owner is activated.

> [!NOTE]
> **Fallback**: If the `dpm` command still fails after removing accounts (some devices retain hidden accounts), perform a factory reset: Settings → System → Reset → Factory data reset. After reset, do **not** add any account before activating Device Owner.

| 📋 Step | 🎯 Action |
|---|---|
| **1️⃣ Developer Mode** | Settings → About tablet → Tap "Build number" 7 times |

|---|---|
| **🔌 Connect USB** | Use USB cable to connect tablet to PC |
| **📱 Allow Debugging** | Check "Always allow from this computer" |

#### 🔍 2. Verify Connection

```
List of devices attached

```

If you see "unauthorized" → Check tablet screen for popup



#### 🏢 3. Set Device Owner



**Run this command:**
```bash
adb shell dpm set-device-owner com.freekiosk/.DeviceAdminReceiver
```

**Expected output:**
```
Success: Device owner set to package com.freekiosk
Active admin set to component {com.freekiosk/com.freekiosk.DeviceAdminReceiver}
```

✅ **Success!** Your tablet is now in Device Owner mode.



#### 🔄 4. Reboot (Optional)

adb reboot
```
